# FD-Reminders
A python program which eases the tedious task of remembering when exactly an FD gets matured so as to renew it or withdraw it from Bank.
The program reads data from a csv file with all the data and calculates the time remaining for a FD to mature.
It then uses google calenedar API to add all these as events into the user's google calendar setting a reminder automatically.
